This can help with reducing acquisition costs per customer, reducing discounts and churn rate. Loyal customers also create direct and indirect network effects, and influence new customers to join the brand.\n","\n","*   The motivation behind this project arises from the fact that businesses are recouping their strategies after COVID-19 and they have to rely on past data to enhance their businesss strategies which provides analysts with an attractive opporutnity to generate patterns from the data. It is a crucial time to decide the future of the retail industry. Clothes are something that everyone buys and it has an undying demand. But, there’s tough competition given the demand in this industry.\n","\n","* Coming from a startup background, it’ll be interesting to see how big brands manage their supply chain to meet consumer demand and generate profits.
